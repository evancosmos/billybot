# Billybot - A misc discord bot for commands I couldn't find elsewhere

## Features:
Set alerts when another user's rich presence updates, such as when when a friend finishes a game, or gets back to their computer after being afk.
Quickly mute and unmute a an entire voice channel (if you have proper server permissions). Great for games that utilize voice mechanics during rounds.

Uses the Discord API and Slash command integration.
