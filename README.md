# Billybot - A misc discord bot for commands I couldn't find elsewhere

## Features:
Set alerts when another user's rich presence updates. Useful for when waiting for when you are doing other tasks while waiting for a friend's game to end.
Quickly mute and unmute a voice channel. Great for games that utilize voice mechanics during rounds.

Uses the Discord API and Slash command integration.
